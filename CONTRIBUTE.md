## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* Fork and then clone the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes, make sure the tests pass.

## Making Trivial Changes

### Documentation
For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not
always necessary to create a new GitHub issue . In this case, it is
appropriate to start the first line of a commit with '(doc)' instead of
an issue number. 

## Submitting Changes

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/bekkibolthouse/Blog).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the (variable) repository in the Stellar organization.
* Update your GitHub issue to mark that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed (Label: “pr”).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
